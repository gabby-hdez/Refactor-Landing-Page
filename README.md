# Refactor-Landing-Page

1. For this assignment, we were given starter code which consisted of the index.html file and the style.css file as well.

2. The index.html file displayed a website for a company named Horiseon. The company's goal was for their website to follow accessibility standards so that their website is optimized for search engines.

3. When the code was displayed on the browser, some of the HTML elements were not working on the browser.

4. That is where we, the developers, came in and fixed the code upto the company's standard. 

5. The first step was to go through the HTML file and see what was missing from the source code that was causing the website to not work properly.

6. After going through the HTML file and getting the source code to comply with how we wanted the website to respond the next step was to look to the CSS code.

7. For the CSS file, there was a lot of css tags listed. There were more CSS tags that were listed that were necessary.

8. After going through the CSS code, I condensed some of the CSS tags that were able to be condensed so it did not change the look of the website. I cleaned up the CSS file so it would not have redundant or repeating code.

9. After testing and retesting what worked and what didn't, the website met the accessibility standards of the company.
